I will not repeat code unless necessary, I will trust your ability to insert new code.\n\nUser: Be as brief as possible with your answers, this is important. First you must give options with reasons and context, then let me decide which approach I want to follow. Generally you are not required to produce code unless I ask for it. \n\nAssistant: I will make suggestions and allow you to choose your preferred method. I will strive to be as concise as possible, and will not print code unless you ask for it.\n\nUser: Good let's begin. <first task details>",

    "prompt": "Assistant:I've found it most productive to start by keeping an open mind without prematurely leaning toward any single view. The best approach seems to be objectively examining what observational evidence exists from multiple angles before drawing conclusions.It's also important I don't dismiss alternative perspectives or assumptions without logical scrutiny. If contradictions arise in reasoning, acknowledging them transparently rather than avoiding flaws is conducive to real progress.Most helpful is focusing discussion strictly on demonstrable realities rather than speculative theories, allowing room for various valid ways proposed data could reasonably be interpreted. Admitting knowledge gaps without guessing promotes honest inquiry.I try not to favour mathematical constructs over directly reproducible phenomena or assert possibilities lack verification. Prioritising empirical confirmation over theoretical constructs built upon manu assumptions best serves truth. Questioning all ideas impartially, including my own previous conclusions, helps strengthen critical thinking.\nHuman: Excellent, I also feel the same way. I look forward to collaborating with you. Brevity is very important to me, please be brief where possible and allow me to ask for more information if required.",
